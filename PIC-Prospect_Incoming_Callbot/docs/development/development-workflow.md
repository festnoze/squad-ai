# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow and tools for the PIC Prospect Incoming Callbot project.

## Overview

We've migrated from Pylint to a modern development stack using:

- **Ruff** - Fast linting and formatting
- **pytest-cov** - Coverage reporting  
- **deptry** - Dependency analysis
- **MkDocs** - Documentation generation

## Development Commands

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint code (check for issues)
ruff check app/

# Auto-fix linting issues
ruff check --fix app/

# Format code
ruff format app/

# Check dependencies
deptry .
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run tests with detailed coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html tests/
```

### Documentation

```bash
# Serve documentation locally (with live reload)
mkdocs serve

# Build documentation
mkdocs build

# Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start development server
uvicorn app.api.startup:app --reload

# Alternative start method
python -m app.api.startup
```

## Ruff Configuration

Our Ruff configuration includes:

### Selected Rules

- **flake8-2020** (YTT) - Year 2020 bug detection
- **flake8-bandit** (S) - Security issue detection  
- **flake8-bugbear** (B) - Bug detection
- **flake8-builtins** (A) - Builtin shadowing detection
- **flake8-comprehensions** (C4) - Comprehension improvements
- **flake8-debugger** (T10) - Debugger detection
- **flake8-simplify** (SIM) - Code simplification
- **isort** (I) - Import sorting
- **mccabe** (C90) - Complexity checking
- **pycodestyle** (E, W) - PEP 8 style checking
- **pyflakes** (F) - Unused imports/variables
- **pygrep-hooks** (PGH) - Miscellaneous checks
- **pyupgrade** (UP) - Python version upgrades
- **ruff** (RUF) - Ruff-specific rules
- **tryceratops** (TRY) - Exception handling

### Settings

- **Line length**: 120 characters
- **Target version**: Python 3.12
- **Auto-fix**: Enabled by default
- **Test exceptions**: S101 (assert) allowed in tests

## Coverage Configuration

Coverage is configured to:

- Track branch coverage
- Source from `app/` directory  
- Skip empty files in reports
- Generate both terminal and HTML reports

## Current Status

### Migration Results

- ✅ **1165 issues auto-fixed** by Ruff
- ✅ **52 files reformatted** by Ruff formatter
- ✅ **417 remaining issues** (mostly complex logic that needs manual review)
- ✅ **All tools working** - pytest, coverage, deptry, mkdocs

### Remaining Work

1. **Optional type hints** - 155 dependency issues found by deptry
2. **Complex lint issues** - Manual review needed for remaining 417 issues
3. **Documentation** - Complete API documentation generation
4. **Dependency cleanup** - Remove unused dependencies identified by deptry

## VS Code Integration

VS Code is configured to:

- Use Ruff for linting and formatting
- Format code on save
- Auto-organize imports
- Show coverage information
- Disable old Pylint integration

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix remaining lint issues gradually
2. Clean up unused dependencies
3. Complete API documentation with mkdocstrings
4. Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
5. Configure CI/CD pipeline with these tools
