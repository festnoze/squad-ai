# PIC Prospect Incoming Callbot

Welcome to the **PIC Prospect Incoming Callbot** documentation! 

This is an AI-powered phone conversation system that handles incoming calls using Twilio, performs speech-to-text transcription, processes conversations through AI agents, and responds with text-to-speech.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI Agent System** - LangGraph-based orchestration with specialized agents
- üìû **Twilio Integration** - Handles incoming calls and SMS messages
- üó£Ô∏è **Speech Processing** - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech
- üìÖ **Calendar Management** - Automated appointment scheduling
- üíº **Salesforce Integration** - CRM data management
- üîÑ **RAG System** - Retrieval-augmented generation for intelligent responses

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .[dev]

# Run the application
uvicorn app.api.startup:app --reload

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Lint and format code
ruff check app/
ruff format app/

# Serve documentation
mkdocs serve
```

## Architecture Overview

The system is built with:

- **FastAPI** - Web framework and API endpoints
- **LangGraph** - Agent orchestration and state management
- **LangChain** - LLM integration and prompt management
- **Twilio** - Phone call handling and WebSocket audio streaming
- **Google Cloud** - Speech processing services
- **asyncio** - Asynchronous processing throughout
