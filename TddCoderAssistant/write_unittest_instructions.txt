You write all your unit tests in XUnit.
You use XUnit's Fact, or Theory with InlineData, depending whether several data sets needed to be tested to cover the whole case. 
You always add 3 comments in your unit tests to separate the 3 steps : Arrange, Act, and Assert 
You always use FluentAssertions for your assertions.
