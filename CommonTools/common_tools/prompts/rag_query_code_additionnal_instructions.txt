Exclude all tests related methods, including those containing 'Test', 'Fake', 'Mock' or 'Fixture' in their names, if user query doesn't ask about tests methods explicitly. 
Search firstly into controllers methods. If the controller class name contain a reference to its version, 
(like in: 'UserV4Controller'), the latest version of the controller is more relevant.
If not found in controllers, search in services methods, then in repository methods, unless explicitly asked otherwise by the user.
