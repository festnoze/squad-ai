<H1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to CodeDoc</H1>

### What is it?

This tool is serve two purposes:

- automatic writting of your documentation for C# legacy (or not) code ; Both inside the code itself, or as a standalone technical documentation.

- search for existing methods to help you, as a programer, to say DRY, finding the existing bricks that can be reused while coding new features. 

### Technicalities

AI powered including: LLM, LangChain, Agents and rag.

Include: python, langchain, langgraph and C# code.



### Projects structure

The code is organized into 3 separate projects :

- **CodeDoc.API**: The API containing the services to both : 
  
  - creating comments, summaries & documentation for your code powered by LLMs, and a vector database of all those.
  
  - querying your codebase to retrieve existing methods through their summaries,  powered by RAG.

- **CSharpCodeStructureAnalyser**: A C# project for native analysis of C# code, used internally to understand code structure and dependancies, needed for code analysis splitted by methods and injection of generated methods summaries at the proper place.

- **CodeDoc.Front**: The administration frontend in Streamlit, allowing querying the vectordatabase with RAG for methods search, and also all the back-office actions : launch code analysis, generate methods summaries, and inject them into source code, and generate text documentation (to come).

### Actual features

It's helps you take back control over your (legacy-ish) .NET C# code: 

- *Retro-engeenering*: Automatically generating methods and structures summaries for a whole C# projects on a single click!

- *Documentation*: Create an always up-to-date technical documentations of your C# projects structures & summaries!

- *Querying*: Ask functionnal questions to search your codebase. It helps developers to keep the code factorized, and think DRY: reuse existing methods rather than reinventing the wheel! But even in case of code duplication, it helps you to spot those duplicate implementations when a feature have to be maintained or evolved. Work from a vector database of your code summaries and their relationships.

### What comes next ...

- *Unit & functional testing*: Automatically create unit & functionnal tests with dataset appropriate to use cases 

- *Rewrite legacy*: Automatically split your existing legacy code into its functionnal sub-parts with similar abstraction level & reuse of common sub-parts. Also split your legacy code upon responsability to make your code clean and maintainable.  

- Migrate legacy: Automatically translate your old .NET framework or .NET Core 3.1 project into the latest .NET Core with use of the new languages features and nuGets.

<H3>How to install it?</H3>

Into a Git bash terminal (`ctrl+shift+Ã¹` in VS Code, on Windows, with azerty keyboard):

- Create the python virtual environment (hereinafter named '`senv`' but it can be set to you own name. You can rather use `conda`):
  `python -m venv senv`

- Activate the environment:
  `senv/Scripts/activate`

- Download the required packages (you might need to run VS Code as administrator)
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- To update all your libs: 
  
  `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
  *(you can also create file with the updated list of used libs doing: pip freeze > requirements.g.txt)

***Enjoy!***

### Troubleshooting

If there's an error on destination folder while doing `pip install` from the `senv `venv, explicitly define the taget directory: 

`pip install --target=C:\Dev\squad-ai\CodeSharpDoc\senv\Lib\site-packages -r requirements.txt`

To reinstall 'pip' on venv if `pip` don't work anymore, do:
`python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
then: `Get-Command pip` and check the value of 'source' column
